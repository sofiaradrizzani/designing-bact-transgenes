This archive contains all log odds ratios used in the various analyses.

Input data:
Cambray_DataS15.csv is the supplementary Data 15 directly from Cambray et al. Due to the excessive file size, this couldn't be uploaded. Please download (from https://osf.io/pm2qa?view_only=0d5b05fb08d84b76b21f399e832808b6) and rename file "Cambray_DataS15.csv" to progress with the analysis.
1241934tables1.csv is the supplementary Table 1 directly from Goodman et al
Lewin_TableS1.csv is the supplementary Table 1 directly from Lewin et al


STABILITY_CALCULATOR.py
	Requires input files Cambray_DataS15.csv and 1241934tables1.csv. 
	Filters the Cambray data (and outputs to extracted_data.csv)
	Uses the package ViennaRNA (specifically the RNAfold function) to calculate the mRNA stability (MFE) of the 5' region (2-11) of the sequences from the Goodman and Cambray data.
	Outputs: GSTR.csv (Goodman) and CSTR.csv (Cambray).

Calc_allLO_C.py
	Calculates the log odds for the Cambray data for the RNAfold measures, and their columns gs.utrCdsStructureMFE, gs.fivepCdsStructureMFE and the division of columns clean.lin.prot.mean by ss.rna.dna.mean
	Output: Cambray_LOstab_UTRto30.csv, Cambray_LOstab_0to60.csv, Cambray_LOstab_RNAfold.csv, and Cambray_LO_PNInorm.csv

Calc_allLO_G.py
	Calculates the log odds for the Goodman data for the RNAfold measures, and their columns dG, dG.noutr, dG.unif and Prot.FCC, Trans
	Outputs: Goodman_LOstab_dG.csv, Goodman_LOstab_dGnoutr.csv, Goodman_LOstab_dGunif.csv, Goodman_LOstab_RNAfold.csv, and Goodman_LO_protFCC.csv, Goodman_LO_trans.csv

mergeLOall.R
	Merges all log odds from all data sources into a single file.
	From Lewin et al:
		V5prot is the 5’ codon enrichment in the native gene data (top 25% by protein abundance v bottom 25%) as indicated by PaxDB (Wang et al, 2015)
		VedIO is the 5’ enrichment in the experimental transgene data reported by Goodman et al (top 25% by “Prot.FCC” v bottom 25%)
	From Cambray et al:
		LO_PNInorm is the 5’ enrichment in the experimental transgene protein/RNA data (top 25% by “PNI”/”RNAss” v bottom 25%)
		LO_utrCdsStructureMFE is the 5’ enrichment in the reported Minimum Free Energy level of the mRNA structure from position -30 to +30 within constructs with constant sequences from -30 to +3 (top 25% by “gs.utrCdsStructureMFE” v bottom 25%)
		LO_fivepCdsStructureMFE is 5’ enrichment in the reported Minimum Free Energy level of the mRNA structure from position 0 to +60 (top 25% by “gs.fivepCdsStructureMFE” v bottom 25%)
		LO_RNAfold_C is 5’ enrichment in the RNA stability measure generated by the Vienna R package for the segment of 10 codons following the start codon of Cambray et al sequences
	From Goodman et al: 
		LO_protFCC is 5’ enrichment in the experimental transgene protein data (top 25% by “Prot.FCC” v bottom 25%, which is equal to VedIO from Lewin et al above)
		LO_trans is 5’ enrichment in the experimental transgene protein/RNA data (top 25% by “trans” v bottom 25%)
		LO_dG is 5’ enrichment in RNA folding energy of the entire transcript, from the TSS to +96 (top 25% by “dG” v bottom 25%)
		LO_dGnoutr is 5’ enrichment in RNA folding energy of the transcript starting at the beginning of the CDS (top 25% by “dG.noutr” v bottom 25%)
		LO_dGunif is 5’ enrichment in RNA folding energy of the transcript cut off at position -5 (top 25% by “dG.unif” v bottom 25%)
		LO_RNAfold_G is 5’ enrichment in the RNA stability measure generated by the Vienna R package for the segment of 10 codons following the start codon of Goodman et al sequences.
