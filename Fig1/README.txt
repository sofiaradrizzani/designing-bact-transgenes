Input data: TableS1.csv contains all log odds calculated for each metric. See directory TableS1 for more information on the data preprocessing.
	
plotFig1_CambrayVnative.R
	Takes columns LO_PNInorm (for Cambray) and V5prot (for native gene expression recorded on PaxDB, log odds from Lewin et al) and plots the two codon enrichments against each other, as well as the pairwise comparisons with codon synonyms.
	Output: Fig1.pdf
